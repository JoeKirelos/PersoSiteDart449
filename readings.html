            <h2>Everything is a remix & GNU manifesto</h2>
            <p>Everything is a Remix is a hilarious video. I enjoyed it a lot and it pairs very nicely with the GNU manifesto. Personally it brings up rather political discussions for me as the first thing I think of when I think of everything being a remix and GNU is open source software. The reason that quickly gets political is because of this thought that one should never do something for free. I do not recall which “tech Billionaire” said it about code, but they said something to the extent of, you should never do your programming for free. Yet looking at the best performing software in terms of stability, privacy and user satisfaction, a lot of it is open source. Which further leads me to think about the idea of universal automation. If everyone was capable of coding and wasn’t doing it for monetary gain, it is estimated that within 5-10 years we would automate pretty much every job on the planet. This would leave humans to pursue other things such as art and entertainment and move from working for material gain into a Universal Basic Income model. At which point the idea of everything being a remix would be further explored, since at that point the creation of art would be purely for the purpose of self expression, the need for the draconian copyright laws that are currently in place would be reduced. While that is a very positive, bordering on unrealistic, exploration of the current political climate as it relates to unpaid collaborative work on things such as open source software, I can’t help being fascinated by that imaginary utopia and appreciate that what would bring it about is people who are willing to share their skills for the sake of being part of something greater and making the world a better place as opposed to finding ways to extract as much money out of consumers as possible.

            <h2>Writing the history of the internet</h2>
            <p>A very interesting article, it makes me think about open source software and copyright issues. For open source, I find myself torn, on the one hand I try to use open source software as often as possible, browsers like Firefox or Brave over Chrome and Opera, code editors like Atom or VSCode, OpenOffice over Microsoft Office or Google’s things. I always hit a wall eventually and am forced to compromise, things like the adobe suite or dropbox which I am required to use for my job, which brings me to the fundamental part of something I wish I was unable to compromise on, but am forced to, the OS I run. I would love to wipe windows off my personal computer and use one of the many Linux Distros instead, but I am shackled by work, proprietary software like the aforementioned Adobe suite, simply do not support Linux. While the freedom, security, privacy and stability that are afforded by using open source software make it attractive for users, corporations that don’t develop tech are drawn to the big names, the “industry standards” and corporations that do will stop at nothing to make sure they become the big name or industry standard, even if it means locking out users on certain operating systems. The other major issue with open source content, which also extends to copyright in general is that the authors or creators of something basically waive their ownership rights when they allow the content to be used freely. An issue which has been occurring a lot recently where certain entities file a copyright on content made using royalty free assets and then suing the author or other entities for copyright infringement. There are fundamental issues in the laws the govern intellectual property and copyright which makes the freedom and openness of things like unix or usenet seem like a waste of time and encourage people to always try to monetize their content, which puts a ceiling on the creativity and development as discussed in the vannevar bush article, without collaboration development is slowed down significantly.</p>
            <h2>As we may think</h2>
            <p>I found myself drawn to one idea in the article above all others, the idea of a “growing mountain of research” this idea reminded me of a number I’d heard from a professor a while back, the number is no more than 10… what that number signifies, the number of people who read a peer reviewed scholarly article. While I have no idea as to the accuracy of said number as unfortunately the professor did not cite their source mentioning it. That number stuck with me as it reminded me of an essay I had to write for a humanities class, the topic of which being was the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a necessary effort to end the war. Initially writing that article my thought process was that there is no way using a weapon of mass destruction is a necessity. I, however, a fresh college student at the time was told I had to use scholarly articles, so I went to the library and to Google and started looking for those. To my surprise all the articles I found highlighted how the atomic bombing on Japan was necessary to ending the war. At the time I assumed I had simply been mistaken, after all the historical scholarly peer reviewed articles said so, and so it must be. I wrote my essay got a good grade and went forward with changed beliefs about the necessity of the atomic bomb in ending WWII. Until I heard that number from a professor a couple of years later. No more than 10 people had read those articles I based my essay on, if I am to also quote Vannevar Bush “The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers—conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp” If hundreds or even thousands of historians wrote about the topic, how many did I consult? How many had reached the same conclusion, if no more than 10 had agreed on the articles I consulted to draw my conclusion about that essay, how many more disagreed with that assessment. Finding an answer when is looking for in scholarly articles is difficult and the existence of so many of those articles, articles that are approved and added to a mountain of “sources” for further scholarly writing, by a mere ten people begs the thought, how much of what is written in scholarly articles factually accurate.</p>
