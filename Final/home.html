        <h3>Artist statement</h3>
        <p>My Covid Diary is meant to offer a couple of different experiences to those who choose to participate in it. It can be simply to entertain, or to educate, however, the one I intended for is to invite reflection. Given how long the pandemic has gone on for, it is easy to find oneself losing time going from one thing to the next without ever pausing to reflect on how they feel about their situation. Anecdotally, I found myself in that position, where upon finishing the making of this project I found that it invited me to reflect upon how I managed to cope with the pandemic over the past couple of years. Where I initially had hoped to discuss the advantages of being an introvert during the time of Covid, I found, after some research, that those advantages were unique to my situation. I then proceeded with the intention of sharing my findings for a bit of educational value. While I certainly hope that I have managed to do that, my satisfaction with this project comes from the belief, as I can't call it knowledge, that after finishing this brief experience, some people will pause and think for a few minutes about how the past couple of years went for them, how they managed to cope with them and whether they could reach out and help or seek help from others.</p>

        <h3>Thoughts behind creation</h3>
        <p>In terms of the content, I considered the form carefully, it is meant to be a personal diary of someone going through the pandemic. That is why I made the choice to phrase all the "questions" I intended to ask as first person statements, "I lost my job due to the pandemic" for example. In terms of art, it being a personal diary I decided to keep the drawings included very loose as people generally don't share their diaries so if they doodled something on the side and it didn't look good they wouldn't really bother fixing it. The overall theme is meant to reflect that private diary aesthetic with the twist being that as the risks of isolation and stress rise as the user continues answering questions the font would get more aggressively jagged and the drawings more distorted. I also chose to maintain the feeling of personal diary by creating a flowchart of questions to ask based on the previous answers. So if a person is over the age of 60 they would be prompted with "I have retired during the pandemic" if they're under the age of 18 instead of being asked where they'd be at a party to determine if they're an introvert, they'd be asked where they'd be during lunchtime at school. I believe that while the interactivity remains overall rather generalized, these small elements would lend it a bit more of a personal feeling which would help achieve the intended experience highlighted above.</p>
