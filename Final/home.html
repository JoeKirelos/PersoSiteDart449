        <p>My Covid Diary is meant to offer a couple of different experiences to those who choose to participate in it. It can be simply to entertain, or to educate, however, the one I intended for is to invite reflection. Given how long the pandemic has gone on for, it is easy to find oneself losing time going from one thing to the next without ever pausing to reflect on how they feel about their situation. Anecdotally, I found myself in that position, where upon finishing the making of this project I found that it invited me to reflect upon how I managed to cope with the pandemic over the past couple of years. Where I initially had hoped to discuss the advantages of being an introvert during the time of Covid, I found, after some research, that those advantages were unique to my situation. I then proceeded with the intention of sharing my findings for a bit of educational value. While I certainly hope that I have managed to do that, my satisfaction with this project comes from the belief, as I can't call it knowledge, that after finishing this brief experience, some people will pause and think for a few minutes about how the past couple of years went for them, how they managed to cope with them and whether they could reach out and help or seek help from others.</p>
