        <p>Before you Begin this Interactivity it is important to understand the following points</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This is a highly generalized experience that will not fit every situation perfectly, pick the answer that most closely resembles your own situation</li>
            <li>This is meant to be as inclusionary as possible, any misrepresentation or exclusion was not done on purpose, it was either due to lack of time or an oversight on my (the creator's) behalf</li>
            <li>This is not in any way shape or form a substitute for professional help, I am not certified to provide any form of mental health assistance and this should not be taken as such under any circumstance</li>
            <li>The results of the experience might, in some cases, be errenous. There will be an explanation of the results obtained, if they do not apply to you there might have been a miscalculation in the parameters. You're welcome to try again with slightly different answers or disregard the results if you find them inapplicable or unsatisfactory</li>
            <li>There will be no statistics in the analysis, the reason for that is simple, the research made, while it helps understand some of the psychology behind the situation, its usage of statistics is purely scientific. The analysis includes the actionable conclusions from the research without the scientific statistics.</li>
